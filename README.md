# Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

-   User-Friendly Interface: Prompts the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation.
-   Supports Four Operations: Handles `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `/` (division).
-   Error Handling: Catches invalid input (non-numeric) and prevents division by zero.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x installed on your machine.
