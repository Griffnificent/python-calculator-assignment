# Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

-   User-Friendly Interface: Prompts the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation.
-   Supports Four Operations: Handles `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `/` (division).
-   Error Handling: Catches invalid input (non-numeric) and prevents division by zero.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Instructions

1.  Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
    *Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.*

2.  Navigate to the Project Directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  Run the Script:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

The program will then prompt you to enter the numbers and the desired operation.

## Example
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
